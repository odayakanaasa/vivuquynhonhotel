    Wake up in the morning after a good night's sleep in a large comfortable bed, have brekkie overlooking a beautiful bay, 
    have a wash in a brand new and spacious shower and head out to the mountains or the sea for a lovely day out in gorgeous Greece.
     Great place - couldn't recommend enough.
