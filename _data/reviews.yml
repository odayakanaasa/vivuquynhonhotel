    Wake up in the morning after a good night's sleep in a large comfortable bed, have brekkie overlooking a beautiful bay, 
    have a wash in a brand new and spacious shower and head out to the mountains or the sea for a lovely day out in gorgeous Greece.
     Great place - couldn't recommend enough.

    From the moment we arrived when Helena brought us cheese and honey pastries, to the moment we left when Joseph (I think) hosed our dirty hire car down, 
    we had a wonderful time at the Ansi apartments. Smartly refurbed just in the last couple of months, with a great shower, much needed air con, wifi that 
    generally worked, a newly delivered table and mirror (in just the right place, which is a novelty, as any female will know), we have a marvellous time at the 
    lovely Ansi. The view was indeed beautiful, overlooking a gorgeous bay and well placed to watch the sunset. Thanks for everything!

    This was our second visit to Almyrida. Staying at the Ansi Apartments this
    time was an even better experience. with the fantastic views from the
    balcony and being only a few minutes walk from the beach. The apartment
    itself was beyond expectation it was very well furnished and fitted out to
    a very high standard, and Joseph and his family where very welcoming and
    friendly .We would have no hesitation recommending the Ansi.Loverly stay .
    Paul and Mandy .Back soon !

    Eine sehr liebevoll geführte Pension. Alle Zimmer haben Meerblick, es ist sehr sauber und gepflegt. 
    Man kann hier sehr ruhige Abende auf dem Balkon verbringen. Der schöne Sandstrand ist über eine Treppe in wenigen Minuten erreicht. 
    Die Umgebung ist für Ruhesuchende ein Genuss.

    View from the room at the sea, near the sandy beach, water activities - surfing, kayaks, catamarans and so on. Restaurants on the waterfront. 
    But in the room there is silence, he is taller and slightly off the beaten path. Parking near the house. 
    It has a kitchenette with everything you need. (translated from Russian)

      Warm and welcoming hosts,nothing was too much bother.I felt immediately at home. 
      The most amazing view from the balcony and perfect for morning coffee and pastries from the local bakery. 
      Also sipping wine and watching the sun set after a hard day on the beach.

  review: The view from the balcony is simply breathtaking… just want to sit, drink wine, read and enjoy the view of Souda Bay. The hosts were so sweet, gracious and caring. Apartment was spotless. Simple but everything we needed. Aircon was good. Wifi was excellent. Beautifully cared for courtyards & balconyies with bougainvillia & vines.
